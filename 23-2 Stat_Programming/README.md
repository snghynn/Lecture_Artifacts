This was a course called 'Statistics Programming' at EWHA.
In this course, I learned about PyTorch and deep learning. 
The intuitive usability and flexibility of PyTorch enabled me to easily construct and experiment with complex models. 
The support for dynamic computation graphs allows developers to apply changes in real-time, making the debugging and model optimization processes significantly easier.

Through this course, I was able to build a deep understanding of both foundational and advanced concepts in deep learning, particularly gaining the ability to effectively perform various image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset. 
These skills have significantly contributed to solving real-world problems in domains such as image recognition. 
Additionally, the vast community and rich ecosystem of libraries made it easy to find learning resources and references, allowing me to quickly adapt to the latest research trends.
