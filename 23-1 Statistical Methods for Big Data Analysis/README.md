This was a course called 'Big Data Analysis Methodology.' 
In this course, I delved into foundational concepts of machine learning and deep learning. 
I learned to utilize Python for data analysis, covering essential libraries such as Numpy and Pandas, which facilitated effective data handling and statistical analysis.

The course provided me with a robust understanding of regression and classification techniques, enabling me to build predictive models using algorithms like linear regression and decision trees. 
I also explored advanced topics such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), gaining practical experience through hands-on projects with datasets like MNIST.

These skills have empowered me to tackle real-world challenges in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing. 
The course's emphasis on practical coding alongside theoretical knowledge allowed me to effectively implement machine learning models. 
Furthermore, the supportive learning environment and access to a wealth of resources facilitated my understanding of the latest advancements in the field.
